Jack is based in the San Diego area and started playing video games at the young age of six. Jack fell in love with the sound of games, which prompted him to start messing around with musical instruments and audio production software's. This grew into a fascination in his early life creating music and game design ideas with friends from school. This fascination turned into a career, when he started attending UC San Diego as an ICAM major. Jack started getting serious and decided to join his friend's company to develop video games. Now Jack has a well versed tool kit of multiple audio/computing software's under his belt with the capabilities to learn and understand even more about the audio computing world.
